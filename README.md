## Introduction

Hello there! üëã I'm thrilled to share my Cloud Resume Challenge project with you. This isn't just another resume‚Äîit's a fully interactive, cloud-powered experience designed to showcase my skills in cloud computing and web development. From hosting my resume on AWS S3 to integrating a visitor counter powered by DynamoDB, this project has it all. Let's take a closer look at how everything comes together.

## Project Overview

Imagine having a resume that's not just a static document but a dynamic, living webpage that tracks visitors and handles interactions seamlessly. Sounds cool, right? This project is all about making that happen. The Cloud Resume Challenge pushes you to build a modern cloud application using a variety of AWS services, ensuring the solution is secure, scalable, and highly available.

## Services Used

Here's a quick rundown of the AWS services that make this magic happen:

- **Amazon S3**: Hosts the static website files (HTML, CSS, JS). Think of it as the cozy home for my resume.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Distributes the content globally with low latency, making sure my resume is super fast wherever you are.
- **Amazon Route 53**: Manages DNS for my custom domain. It's like the phonebook for the internet, directing traffic to my site.
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes backend logic for the visitor counter and contact form. These are my little workers running code in response to events.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Stores visitor count data. This is the brain keeping track of all the visitors.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for the Lambda functions. It‚Äôs the bridge connecting the front end to the back end.
- **Amazon SES**: Sends emails from the contact form. It's the postman delivering your messages to my inbox.
- **Terraform**: Manages the infrastructure as code. It‚Äôs the blueprint that builds and maintains my cloud environment.
- **GitHub Actions**: Implements CI/CD for automated deployments. Think of it as my personal butler, ensuring everything runs smoothly with each update.

## Service Architecture

Check out the architecture diagram below to see how all these pieces fit together:

### Architecture Explanation

1. **Static Website**: The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are stored in an S3 bucket configured to host a static website. Simple yet effective.
2. **CloudFront Distribution**: Distributes the website content globally and provides HTTPS. Because everyone deserves a fast and secure browsing experience.
3. **Route 53**: Points your custom domain to the CloudFront distribution. It ensures that when you type in my domain, you get to my site without a hitch.
4. **API Gateway**: Provides endpoints for the backend services. It‚Äôs like the bouncer at a club, ensuring only the right requests get in.
5. **Lambda Functions**:
    - **Visitor Counter**: Updates and retrieves the visitor count from DynamoDB. It‚Äôs always keeping tabs on who‚Äôs visiting.
    - **Contact Form Handler**: Sends an email with the contact form details using SES. Making sure I never miss a message from you.
6. **DynamoDB**: Stores the visitor count data. Think of it as a digital guestbook.
7. **Amazon SES**: Sends email notifications from the contact form submissions.

## Directory Structure

Here's how everything is organized in the project:
